This is a simple project for transferring files between my school and friends using the terminal. It's lightweight, straightforward, and gets the job done.

There’s not much to say about this tool—it’s designed to be practical and easy to use. If you’ve stumbled across this repo and don’t need a tool like this, feel free to move along. Otherwise, welcome, and happy transferring!
